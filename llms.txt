# circle

R client package for the Continuous Integration (CI) provider ‘Circle
CI’. [Circle CI](https://circleci.com/) stands in line with [GitHub
Actions](https://github.com/features/actions), [Travis
CI](https://www.travis-ci.com/),
[AppVeyor](https://ci.appveyor.com/login) and many more CI providers.
[Circle CI](https://circleci.com/) heavily relies on Docker containers
for runner execution.

Continuous Integration (CI) / Continuous Deployment (CD) is heavily used
in the IT world to automatically perform certain actions after a
specific trigger (e.g. after each commit). When developing R packages
the most common uses cases are to check the package on each commit for
CRAN eligibility (by running `R CMD Check`) and to deploy a
[{pkgdown}](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown) documentation page for the
package.

This package aims help to set up CI/CD with the service provider [Circle
CI](https://circleci.com/) and provides R functions to execute CI
specific tasks such as build restarts, log queries or setting
environment variables from within R. It also simplifies the setup
process for build deployments via
[`use_circle_deploy()`](https://docs.ropensci.org/circle/reference/use_circle_deploy.html).
All functionality relies on calls to the [Circle CI REST
API](https://circleci.com/docs/api/v2/#circleci-api).

There are two ways to use this package:

- Via the high-level functions of this package which wrap common API
  calls:
  - [`get_pipelines()`](reference/builds.md)
  - [`get_checkout_keys()`](reference/checkout_key.md)
  - [`set_env_var()`](reference/env_var.md)
  - etc.
- Via direct API calls through the workhorse function
  [`circle()`](https://docs.ropensci.org/circle/reference/circle.html).

{circle} does not come with an option to setup Circle CI YAML files.
Please see the related [{tic}](https://github.com/ropensci/tic) package
for such functionality and more CI workflow related tools. {circle} aims
to provide a handy and flexible high-level interface to the [Circle CI
API](https://circleci.com/docs/api/v2/) without shipping opinionated
workflow functionality.

## API versions

All functionality uses the Circle CI [API
v2](https://github.com/CircleCI-Archived/api-preview-docs) which follows
the **pipelines** -\> **workflows** -\> **jobs** approach. This API
version is still in beta and might undergo some changes in the near
future.

Some functions/endpoints can also be used via API versions v1.1 and v1
by setting the `api_version` argument. However, this will only work if
the respective API endpoint is available for the chosen API version.
Usually, there should be no need in practice to fall back to API version
\< 2.

For more information on the differences between the [Circle CI
API](https://circleci.com/docs/api/v2/) versions, have a look at the
[document explaining changes between v1.1 and
v2](https://github.com/CircleCI-Archived/api-preview-docs/blob/master/docs/api-changes.md).
